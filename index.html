          </p>
          <ol class="text-start">
            <li><b>Plot:</b> The plot of a play or novel is the order in which the author puts things to build the main theme. A planned, logical sequence of events with a beginning, middle, and end is typically referred to as the plot.</li>
            <br><li><b>Freytag’s Pyramid:</b> In 350 BCE, Greek philosopher Aristotle noted in his work Poetics that a drama's cohesive story structure is shaped like a fundamental triangle. The Greeks referred to the lowest left as protasis, the highest middle as epistasis, and the lowest right as catastrophe, which represents the resolution of the struggle. Freytag's Pyramid is a modification of Aristotle's structure in which he transformed the triangle into a pyramid and added two additional levels: the rising action (or complication) between the lowest left and highest middle, and the falling action between the highest middle and lowest right end. Freytag utilised these five components to analyse the structure: Exposure to the left is at its lowest.</li>
            <br><li><b>Different types of characters:</b> The protagonist is the central character. The antagonist can be simply trimmed as the villain. Flat characters are one-dimensional. Round characters not only become diametrically opposite to what they were at the beginning of the story, they turn out to be fully grown personalities. Dynamic characters show changes and grow too. They surprise us. Static characters do not show any change.</li>
            <br><li><b>Conflict:</b> Opposition is vital to the storyline because it links events and advances the story. Conflicts are not just restricted to disagreements; the main character may encounter them in any shape or form. In a brief narrative, there could be a single main conflict or numerous smaller conflicts wrapped up in a larger one.</li>
            <br><li><b>The various kinds of Point of View</b>:
              <br><b>First Person:</b> Narrated by a character who is either the protagonist or a close associate of the protagonist; the speaker employs the pronouns "I," "me," and "we." The entire story is told through one character's eyes, and readers are limited to understanding only what he or she is aware of.
            <br><b>Second Person:</b>Story told by a narrator who addresses the reader or some other assumed “you”; speaker uses pronouns you, your, yours. For example: You wake up to discover that you have been robbed of all of your worldly possessions.
            <br><b>Third Person:</b>Story told by a narrator who addresses the reader or some other assumed “you”; speaker uses pronouns you, your, yours. For example: You wake up to discover that you have been robbed of all of your worldly possessions.
            <br><b>Limited:</b> Probably the easiest POV for a beginning writer to use limited POV funnels all action through the eyes of a single character; readers only see what the narrator sees.
            <br><b>Omniscient:</b> God-like, the narrator knows and sees everything, and can move from one character’s mind to another. Authors can be omniscient narrators by moving from character to character, event to event, and introducing information at their discretion. This is the POV utilised by O.Henry  in The Cop and the Anthem. 
            <br><b>Innocent Eye/Naive Narrative:</b> The story is told through a child's eye; narrator’s judgement is different from that of an adult.
            <br><b>Stream of Consciousness:</b> A kind of narration in which readers only experience a character’s thoughts and reactions. 
            
            
            <br></li><br>
            <li><b>Aspects to be considered while studying the setting of a story:</b> <br><b>Place:</b> Geographical location, where is the story taking place?<br><b>Time:</b> Historical period, the time of the day, month, year, etc., Season and Weather conditions, Social Conditions, Mood or atmosphere
            </li>
          </ol>
          <br><br>
         <p class="text-start"> <b>Aspects to be considered while studying the  theme of a story:</b> Story’s title usually emphasises what the author is saying. Various figures of speech (symbolism, allusion, simile, metaphor, hyperbole or irony) may be utilised to highlight the theme</p>
